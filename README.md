+ import * as BABYLON from "@babylonjs/core";window. to the start
+ change all a and cc to be the window kind
+ change default_speed to window version and cameraRightAngle (maybe more)

make all maps look like infiltration.json
https://github.com/GuySandler/dodoloader-NE/blob/main/src/maps/infiltration.json
